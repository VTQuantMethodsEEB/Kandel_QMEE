# Kandel_QMEE
This repo contains all the information required for Quantitative methods in Ecology and Evolution.

<p> ##Week 1 Assignment
<p> Write a paragraph about your data describing your goals for the semester.

<p> This dataset contains two years’ worth of high-frequency (10 Hz) carbon/water flux data with a suite of meteorological data collected using the Eddy Covariance method from the Falling Creek reservoir in Venton, Virginia. Carbon dioxide and methane are the two major green-house gases exchanged across freshwater-atmosphere interface that contribute to the warming of atmosphere globally through heat trapping mechanisms in the troposphere. Thus, long-term monitoring and exploration of the drivers of these fluxes can address some of the big questions: (a) How do small freshwater reservoirs respond to changing climate in terms of gas exchange? (b) Can we predict the carbon fluxes in the near future? (c) How can we better manage these natural resources for a sustainable reservoir ecosystem (e.g., aerated future)? My goal for one of the dissertation chapters would be to answer these questions by: (1) the characterization of seasonal dynamics of the gas exchange as a proxy of reservoir’s biological activities, and (2) the analysis of drivers of carbon fluxes as an understanding of their responses to changing climate.


<p> #Week 2 Assignment

<p> CODE : week2_Kandel_QMEE

<p> DATA: project_data.csv

Here, I practiced tidying the format of my data. I used group_by to take a mean of ET across seasons and also used mutate function to create an additional column to calculate ET from LE.

#The end!
